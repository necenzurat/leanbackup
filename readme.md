# `$ ./leanbackup` - WIP

> Make backups ~~great~~ easy again.

## About

ðŸ“¦  leanback provides a simple way to backup stuff.
It uses restic and has an installer for generating backup policies.
And it's all written in good ol' bash.

## Usage

1. Run the installer
2. Forget about it


## Repo structure

All repoos are located into the backups folder, examples are located in the templates folder.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ repo-name
    â”œâ”€â”€ .env (secrets file)
    â”œâ”€â”€ backup
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ db-backup.sh (how backups are done)
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ files-backup.sh (how db backups are done)
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ cleanup.sh (how the clenup is done)
    â””â”€â”€ sync
        â””â”€â”€ sync.sh (hot the syncing is done)
```
and that's about it.

You can add as many .sh file as you see fit, they are loaded automagically.
